## üëã Hi there 
I am Bernardo, an aeronautical engineer with a BSc in Aeronautical Engineering and (soon: hopefully :P) an MSc in Data Science. My passion lies in both coding and engineering. I am from Zurich üá®üá≠ and have over seven years of experience working as an aeronautical engineer and about two years as a data scientist.

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Experience  
In my role at Bucher Leichtbau AG, I provided advice and support to all departments regarding initial airworthiness certification. My expertise included interpreting certification specifications, verifying documentation for "minor" and "major changes," and communicating with customers, official bodies, and authorities. I also provided consulting services to the development department for design optimization.

I switched to data science back in 2021. At Crealogix AG, I provided advice and support to the department on new data science and machine learning products. I created prospect and upsell models, extracted information from fact-sheets using a customized OCR, and developed user journeys for chatbot dialogue flow. Furthermore, I developed chatbot solutions using IBM Watson and Spacy. 

After Crealogix, I joined Prognolite AG, where I developed regression models to predict turnover and menu sales using customer data and external data such as weather or public holidays. We used Multi-Output Regression, Quartoüëç, R, and Python, and customized API calls to fetch the data from the database - really cool stuff ‚ö°.

At the moment, I am finishing my Master's thesis üôà, and soon, I will be working for... (to be continued üòé).
