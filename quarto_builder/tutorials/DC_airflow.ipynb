These can include any given task, such as downloading a file, copying data, filtering information, writing to a database, and so forth. A workflow is of varying levels of complexity. Some workflows may only have 2 or 3 steps, while others consist of hundreds of components. \n",

It's important to note that we're defining a workflow here in a general data engineering sense. This is an informal definition to introduce the concept. As you'll see later, workflow can have specific meaning within specific tools.\n",

    "# Section 2: Airflow DAGs\n",
    "Our first question is what is a DAG? Beyond any specific mathematical meaning, a DAG, or Directed Acyclic Graph, has the following attributes: \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is **Directed**, meaning there is an inherent flow representing the dependencies or order between execution of components. These dependencies (even implicit ones) provide context to the tools on how to order the running of components. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A DAG is also **Acyclic** - it does not loop or repeat. This does not imply that the entire DAG cannot be rerun, only that the individual components are executed once per run. \n",

    "- In this case, a **Graph** represents the components and the relationships (or dependencies) between them. \n",

    "## DAG in Airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "As we're working with Airflow, let's look at its implementation of the DAG concept. Within Airflow, DAGs are written in Python, but can use components written in other languages or technologies. This means we'll define the DAG using Python, but we could include Bash scripts, other executables, Spark jobs, and so on. Airflow DAGs are made up of components to be executed, such as operators, sensors, etc. Airflow typically refers to these as tasks. We'll cover these in much greater depth later on, but for now think of a task as a thing within the workflow that needs to be done. Airflow DAGs contain dependencies that are defined, either explicitly or implicitly. These dependencies define the execution order so Airflow knows which components should be run at what point within the workflow. For example, you would likely want to copy a file to a server prior to trying to import it to a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define a DAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at defining a simple DAG within Airflow. When defining the DAG in Python, you must first import the DAG object from airflow dot models. Once imported, we create a default arguments dictionary consisting of attributes that will be applied to the components of our DAG. These attributes are optional, but provide a lot of power to define the runtime behavior of Airflow. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we define the owner name as jdoe, an email address for any alerting, and specify the start date of the DAG. The start date represents the earliest datetime that a DAG could be run. Finally, we define our DAG object with the first argument using a name for the DAG, etl underscore workflow, and assign the default arguments dictionary to the default underscore args argument. There are many other optional configurations we will use later on. \n",
    "\n",

Typically Airflow operators run independently - meaning that all resources needed to complete the task are contained within the operator. Generally, Airflow operators do not share information between each other. This is to simplify workflows and allow Airflow to run the tasks in the most efficient manner. It is possible to share information between operators, but the details of how are beyond this course. Airflow contains many various operators to perform different tasks. For example, the DummyOperator can be used to represent a task for troubleshooting or a task that has not yet been implemented. \n",

If this is required, you must explicitly set it up. You may need to set up environment variables, especially for the BashOperator. \n",

As mentioned in the previous lesson, this is often referred to as the number of worker slots available. We'll discuss some of these in more detail soon, but a few examples of executors are: \n",

I tend to prefer using Vim with some Python tools loaded, or VSCode but it's really up to your preference. There are two quick methods to check for these issues - airflow list_dags, and running your DAG script with python.\n",

Airflow treats it a bit differently - it's considered the amount of time a task or a DAG should require to run. An SLA miss is any situation where a task or DAG does not meet the expected timing for the SLA. If an SLA is missed, an email alert is sent out per the system configuration and a note is made in the log. Any SLA miss can be viewed in the Browse, SLA Misses menu item of the web UI.\n",
