    "\n",
    "## What is a workflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can really discuss Airflow, we need to talk about workflows. A workflow is a set of steps to accomplish a given data engineering task. These can include any given task, such as downloading a file, copying data, filtering information, writing to a database, and so forth. A workflow is of varying levels of complexity. Some workflows may only have 2 or 3 steps, while others consist of hundreds of components. \n",

    "The complexity of a workflow is completely dependent on the needs of the user. We show an example of a possible workflow to the right. It's important to note that we're defining a workflow here in a general data engineering sense. This is an informal definition to introduce the concept. As you'll see later, workflow can have specific meaning within specific tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Quick introduction to DAGs\n",

    "To get started, let's look at how to run a component of an Airflow workflow. These components are called tasks and simply represent a portion of the workflow. We'll go into further detail in later chapters. There are several ways to run a task, but one of the simplest is using the airflow run shell command. \n",

For our example, we'll use a dag_id of example-etl, a task named download-file, and a start date of 2020-01-10. This task would simply download a specific file, perhaps a daily update from a remote source. Our command as such is airflow run example-etl download-file 2020-01-10.

    "# Section 2: Airflow DAGs\n",
    "Our first question is what is a DAG? Beyond any specific mathematical meaning, a DAG, or Directed Acyclic Graph, has the following attributes: \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is **Directed**, meaning there is an inherent flow representing the dependencies or order between execution of components. These dependencies (even implicit ones) provide context to the tools on how to order the running of components. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A DAG is also **Acyclic** - it does not loop or repeat. This does not imply that the entire DAG cannot be rerun, only that the individual components are executed once per run. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this case, a **Graph** represents the components and the relationships (or dependencies) between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term DAG is found often in data engineering, not just in Airflow but also Apache Spark, Luigi, and others^[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph].\n",

    "![](../imgs/0X78.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## DAG in Airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "As we're working with Airflow, let's look at its implementation of the DAG concept. Within Airflow, DAGs are written in Python, but can use components written in other languages or technologies. This means we'll define the DAG using Python, but we could include Bash scripts, other executables, Spark jobs, and so on. Airflow DAGs are made up of components to be executed, such as operators, sensors, etc. Airflow typically refers to these as tasks. We'll cover these in much greater depth later on, but for now think of a task as a thing within the workflow that needs to be done. Airflow DAGs contain dependencies that are defined, either explicitly or implicitly. These dependencies define the execution order so Airflow knows which components should be run at what point within the workflow. For example, you would likely want to copy a file to a server prior to trying to import it to a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define a DAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at defining a simple DAG within Airflow. When defining the DAG in Python, you must first import the DAG object from airflow dot models. Once imported, we create a default arguments dictionary consisting of attributes that will be applied to the components of our DAG. These attributes are optional, but provide a lot of power to define the runtime behavior of Airflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from airflow.models import DAG\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we define the owner name as jdoe, an email address for any alerting, and specify the start date of the DAG. The start date represents the earliest datetime that a DAG could be run. Finally, we define our DAG object with the first argument using a name for the DAG, etl underscore workflow, and assign the default arguments dictionary to the default underscore args argument. There are many other optional configurations we will use later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" apperance='simple'}  \n",
    "Note that the entire DAG is assigned to a variable called etl underscore dag. This will be used later when defining the components of the DAG, but the variable name etl underscore dag does not actually appear in the Airflow interfaces. Note, DAG is case sensitive in Python code.\n",
    "::: \n",
    "\n",
    "## DAGs on the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with DAGs (and Airflow in general), you'll often want to use the airflow command line tool. The airflow command line program contains many subcommands that handle various aspects of running Airflow. You've used a couple of these already in previous exercises. Use the \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "airflow -h\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "command for help and descriptions of the subcommands. Many of these subcommands are related to DAGs. You can use the \n",

    "# Section 4: Airflow operators\n",
    "Airflow operators represent a single task in a workflow. This can be any type of task from running a command, sending an email, running a Python script, and so on. Typically Airflow operators run independently - meaning that all resources needed to complete the task are contained within the operator. Generally, Airflow operators do not share information between each other. This is to simplify workflows and allow Airflow to run the tasks in the most efficient manner. It is possible to share information between operators, but the details of how are beyond this course. Airflow contains many various operators to perform different tasks. For example, the DummyOperator can be used to represent a task for troubleshooting or a task that has not yet been implemented. \n",

It is possible to specify environment variables for the bash command to try to replicate running the task as you would on a local system. If you're unfamiliar with environment variables, these are run-time settings interpreted by the shell. It provides flexibility while running scripts in a generalized way.

If this is required, you must explicitly set it up. You may need to set up environment variables, especially for the BashOperator. \n",

    "Let's review everything we've worked with during this course. We started with learning about workflows and DAGs in Airflow. We've learned what an operator is and how to use several of the available ones. We learned about tasks and how they are defined by various types of operators. In addition, we learned about dependencies between tasks and how to set them with bitshift operators. We've used sensors to react to workflow conditions and state. We've scheduled DAGs in various ways. We used SLAs and alerting to maintain visibility on our workflows. We learned about the power of templating in our workflows for maximum flexibility when defining tasks. We've learned how to use branching to add conditional logic to our DAGs. Finally, we've learned about the Airflow interfaces (command line and UI), about Airflow executors, and a bit about how to debug and troubleshoot various issues with Airflow and our own workflows.\n",

    "A few suggestions for next steps include setting up your own environment for practice. You can follow the installation instructions in the Airflow documentation or use a cloud-based Airflow service. Look into other operators or sensors - there are operators available for Amazon's S3, Postgresql operators, HDFS sensors, and so forth. Experiment with dependencies with a large number of tasks. Consider how you expect the workflow to progress and always try to leave as much up to the scheduler as possible to achieve the best performance. Given the length of the course, there is only so much we could cover and we left out some important parts of Airflow such as XCom, connections, and managing the UI further. Refer to the documentation for more ideas. Finally and most importantly, keep building workflows. When you're uncertain how something works, try to build an example that covers what you'd like to accomplish. Look at the views within the Airflow UI to better understand how the system interprets your DAG code. The more you experiment, the better your understanding will grow.\n",
