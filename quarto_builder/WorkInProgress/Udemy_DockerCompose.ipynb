    "Docker has taken the development world by storm in recent years, being the first effective tool that wraps up a piece of software in a complete file system package, installs it on a server, and runs it repeatedly. However, until recently it was difficult to do this with micro-architectures composed of numerous containers that all need to work in conjunction with one another. Enter Docker Compose, the handiest tool to hit the tech world since Docker. Here’s everything you need to know...\n",

    "\n",
    "## Make Your Docker Experience Even More Stress-Free\n",
    "\n",
    "First you’ll cover the basic features using a sample environment, gaining an understanding of restarts, dependencies, and persisting the database with a volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that you’ll progress to networks. You’ll take an in-depth look at isolating containers, aliases and container names, links, using external networks, and how updates affect networking. Then it’s on to the really good stuff; a section each is dedicated to volumes, logging, the Compose CLI, and ‘Composing Compose’ (don’t worry, it won’t be as complicated as it sounds by the time you get there). Finally you’ll learn about Compose in Production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker Compose is a useful tool from the people at Docker. It makes defining and running application environments made up of multiple Docker containers even easier and more efficient. Up until now, starting any more than one or two Docker containers was extremely complicated. With Docker Compose, the entire process just got infinitely better. "

    "You'll notice this is very similar to the verbiage used in the Docker run command and in many cases commands in compose mirror those from docker run. To run this environment all you need to do is exit the file and get to a terminal in the same directory as Docker composed YAML. From there you can issue the command `docker-compose up -d` to make it run in detached mode to launch. Once running the previous command you will see something similar to this output, indicating the the images have been pulled, started and are running. "
