    "text": "Introduction: Pandas and Method Chaining\nMethod chaining is a way to combine multiple pandas operations together into a single line or statement. It is not necessary to use method chaining, but it can make your code more concise and easier to read. In this post, we will look at how to use method chaining to clean and transform a dataset.\nHonestly, since I started using method chaining, I have found it difficult to go back to the old way of writing pandas code. I hope that by the end of this post, you will feel the same way. :)\nLet’s get started! First I show how to use method chaining to import a dataset as follows:\n\n## Data imports\n\ndf = (\n    # use sm \n    sm                          \n    # get datasets attribute\n    .datasets                   \n    # use get_rdataset method\n    .get_rdataset(              \n        \"car_prices\", \n        package='modeldata'\n    )\n    # get data attribute\n    .data\n)\n\nChaining in Python uses () in order to chain methods together. This allows the user to write multiple statements on different lines as showed in the code above. On big advantage of chaining is that it allows the user to write more readable code (one command per line) and debugg it more easily (comment out one line at a time). Not using chaining would require the user to write the code as follows:\ndf = sm.datasets.get_rdataset(\"car_prices\", package='modeldata').data\nUsing chaining makes the code more readable right?\nWhat I like most about chaining is that it allows the user to write more readable code (one command per line) and debugg it more easily (comment out one line at a time). Especially when working with large datasets, it is very useful to be able to comment out one line at a time.\nBefore continuing with the next section, let’s have a look at the data:\n\n(\n    df\n    .head()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Data Preview \n  \n    \n      \n      Price\n      Mileage\n      Cylinder\n      Doors\n      Cruise\n      Sound\n      Leather\n      Buick\n      Cadillac\n      Chevy\n      Pontiac\n      Saab\n      Saturn\n      convertible\n      coupe\n      hatchback\n      sedan\n      wagon\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      22661.05\n      20105\n      6\n      4\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n    \n    \n      1\n      21725.01\n      13457\n      6\n      2\n      1\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n    \n    \n      2\n      29142.71\n      31655\n      4\n      2\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n    \n    \n      3\n      30731.94\n      22479\n      4\n      2\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n    \n    \n      4\n      33358.77\n      17590\n      4\n      2\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset describes the price of sold cars by make, mileage and other features. Let us assume we would like to convert the data into a tidy format. We start with the car features.\n\n(\n    df\n    .melt(\n        id_vars     = [\n            'Price','Mileage', 'Buick', 'Cadillac', \n            'Chevy', 'Pontiac', 'Saab', 'Saturn',\n        ],\n        var_name    = 'Feature',\n        value_name  = 'Value',\n    )\n    .sort_values(\n        by = 'Price',\n    )\n    .head()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Tidy format of car features \n  \n    \n      \n      Price\n      Mileage\n      Buick\n      Cadillac\n      Chevy\n      Pontiac\n      Saab\n      Saturn\n      Feature\n      Value\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      3783\n      8638.93\n      25216\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      Leather\n      0\n    \n    \n      5391\n      8638.93\n      25216\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      coupe\n      0\n    \n    \n      567\n      8638.93\n      25216\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      Cylinder\n      4\n    \n    \n      2175\n      8638.93\n      25216\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      Cruise\n      0\n    \n    \n      6999\n      8638.93\n      25216\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      sedan\n      1\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now continue and see how we can use the assign method to create new columns in our dataframe. We will use the assign method to create a new column called Make which will a vector representation of the car make.\n\n# Define a function to create the Make vector\ndef make_vector(row):\n    makes = [\n        'Buick', 'Cadillac', 'Chevy', \n        'Pontiac', 'Saab', 'Saturn',\n    ]\n    return [int(row[make]) for make in makes]\n\n(\n    df\n    .melt(\n        id_vars     = [\n            'Price','Mileage', 'Buick', 'Cadillac', \n            'Chevy', 'Pontiac', 'Saab', 'Saturn',\n        ],\n        var_name    = 'Feature',\n        value_name  = 'Value',\n    )\n    .assign(\n        Make = lambda df: df.apply(make_vector, axis = 1),\n    )\n    .drop(\n        columns = [\n            'Buick', 'Cadillac', 'Chevy', \n            'Pontiac', 'Saab', 'Saturn',\n        ],\n    )\n    .sort_values(\n        by = 'Price',\n    )\n    .head()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Continued from the previous chain I \n  \n    \n      \n      Price\n      Mileage\n      Feature\n      Value\n      Make\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      3783\n      8638.93\n      25216\n      Leather\n      0\n      [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n    \n    \n      5391\n      8638.93\n      25216\n      coupe\n      0\n      [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n    \n    \n      567\n      8638.93\n      25216\n      Cylinder\n      4\n      [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n    \n    \n      2175\n      8638.93\n      25216\n      Cruise\n      0\n      [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n    \n    \n      6999\n      8638.93\n      25216\n      sedan\n      1\n      [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s continue and use groupby and aggregate the Feature column by the agg method. This will give us the mean of each feature appears in the dataset.\n\n# Define a function to create the Make vector\ndef make_vector(row):\n    makes = [\n        'Buick', 'Cadillac', 'Chevy', \n        'Pontiac', 'Saab', 'Saturn',\n    ]\n    return [int(row[make]) for make in makes]\n\n(\n    df\n    .melt(\n        id_vars     = [\n            'Price','Mileage', 'Buick', 'Cadillac', \n            'Chevy', 'Pontiac', 'Saab', 'Saturn',\n        ],\n        var_name    = 'Feature',\n        value_name  = 'Value',\n    )\n    .assign(\n        Make = lambda df: df.apply(make_vector, axis = 1),\n    )\n    .drop(\n        columns = [\n            'Buick', 'Cadillac', 'Chevy', \n            'Pontiac', 'Saab', 'Saturn',\n        ],\n    )\n    .sort_values(\n        by = 'Price',\n    )\n    .groupby(\n        by = 'Feature',\n    )\n    .agg(\n        {\n            'Value': ['mean'],\n        }\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4:  Continued from the previous chain II \n  \n    \n      \n      Value\n    \n    \n      \n      mean\n    \n    \n      Feature\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Cruise\n      0.752488\n    \n    \n      Cylinder\n      5.268657\n    \n    \n      Doors\n      3.527363\n    \n    \n      Leather\n      0.723881\n    \n    \n      Sound\n      0.679104\n    \n    \n      convertible\n      0.062189\n    \n    \n      coupe\n      0.174129\n    \n    \n      hatchback\n      0.074627\n    \n    \n      sedan\n      0.609453\n    \n    \n      wagon\n      0.079602\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nSummarizing, we could go on forever and adding more steps to our method chain. But I think you get the point. We can do a lot with method chaining and it is a great way to write clean and readable code.\n\n\nConclusion\nMethod chaining in Pandas is a powerful technique that offers several advantages for data manipulation and analysis workflows. It involves combining multiple operations on a DataFrame or Series into a single, concise chain of method calls. This approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and efficiency.\nFirstly, method chaining reduces the need for intermediate variables, streamlining code and making it more readable. By stringing together operations, such as filtering, transforming, and aggregating, the code becomes a clear and sequential representation of the data transformation process.\nSecondly, it encourages the use of functionally composed operations, leading to more modular and reusable code. This modular nature facilitates changes and updates, as adjustments can be made within the chain without affecting other parts of the code.\nFurthermore, method chaining promotes better memory usage and performance optimization. Pandas optimizes these chains under the hood, reducing the creation of unnecessary intermediate copies of data frames, which leads to improved execution speed and reduced memory overhead.\nLastly, method chaining aligns well with the “tidy data” philosophy, as it emphasizes a more structured, organized approach to data manipulation. This promotes consistency and clarity in the analysis process, aiding in collaboration and code maintenance.\nI hope you enjoyed this post and learned something new.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction: Play with GLMs\nDuring my study at HSLU I have learned to use mostly R when it comes to statistic and for some machine learning courses as well. When it comes to work, the most companies I have seen so far, use Python as their main programming language. My previous two employers used Python and R. This article is not going to discuss which language is better, but rather focus on how to use Python and the library statmodels which seems to produce similar outputs as it would in R.\nOne important and cool thing about the statmodels library is that it has a lot of data sets already included. You can find them here. The data set I use is a R data set from Rdatasets. In particular, the dataset from the package modeldata called car_prices is used.\n## Data imports\ndf = (\n    statsmodels.api # imported as sm in following code\n    .datasets\n    .get_rdataset(\"car_prices\", package='modeldata')\n    .data\n)\nAnother important thing about this blog post is the usage of Quarto. Quarto allowed me to write this blog post directly from a Jupyter-Notebook without any fancy and complicated transformations. For more information, please visit the quarto website.\nHowever, let’s start with the analysis. The first thing we do is to import the necessary libraries and the data set.\n\n\nShow the code\n## Data manipulation imports\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n## Display imports\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\n\n## statmodels import\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nimport statsmodels.genmod.families.family as fam\nfrom patsy import dmatrices\n\n## Plot imports\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (5,5/2.5)\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style('whitegrid')\nsns.set_theme()\nsns.set_context(\n    \"paper\", \n    rc={\n        \"figsize\"       :   plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'],\n        'font_scale'    :   1.25,\n    }\n)\n\n\n## Data imports\ndf = (\n    sm\n    .datasets\n    .get_rdataset(\"car_prices\", package='modeldata')\n    .data\n)\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory Data Exploration\nThe data exploration is a crucial step before fitting a model. It allows to understand the data and to identify potential problems. In this notebook, we will explore very briefly the data, as the focus of this article is to understand and apply statmodels.\n\n\nThe data set contains 804 observations (rows) and 18 predictors (columns). The data set contains information about car prices and the variables are described as follows: Price; Mileage; Cylinder; Doors; Cruise; Sound; Leather; Buick; Cadillac; Chevy; Pontiac; Saab; Saturn; convertible; coupe; hatchback; sedan; and wagon.\n\n\nFirst, two approximately continous variables Price and Mileage are investigated by means of graphical analysis. The following bar plots show the distribution of the two variables.\n\n\nShow the code\nheight = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][0]\naspect = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][0]/plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][1] / 2\n\ng1 = sns.displot(\n    data = df,\n    x = 'Price',\n    kde = True,\n    height = height,\n    aspect = aspect,\n)\nplt.title('Distribution of car price')\nplt.xlabel('Price')\nplt.ylabel('Count of occurance')\nplt.show(g1)\n\ng2 = sns.displot(\n    data = df,\n    x = 'Mileage',\n    kde = True,\n    height = height,\n    aspect = aspect,\n)\nplt.title('Distribution of Mileage')\nplt.xlabel('Mileage')\nplt.ylabel('Count of occurance')\nplt.show(g2)\n\n\n/Users/Bernardo/opt/anaconda3/envs/thesis/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py:118: UserWarning: The figure layout has changed to tight\n  self._figure.tight_layout(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\n/Users/Bernardo/opt/anaconda3/envs/thesis/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py:118: UserWarning: The figure layout has changed to tight\n  self._figure.tight_layout(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Distribution of the variable Price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Distribution of the variable Mileage\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of price and mileage variables.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 (a) shows on the left a right-skewed distribution with a peak around 15k$ and price values ranging from 8k dollars to 70k dollars. On the other hand, figure 1 (b) shows on the right a more ballanced distribution with a peak around 20k$ and price values ranging from 266 miles up to 50k miles.\nProceeding to the next two variables, Cylinder and Doors, one can see less possible values, ranging from\n\n\nShow the code\nheight = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][0]\naspect = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][0]/plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][1] / 2\n\ng = sns.displot(\n    data = df,\n    x = 'Cylinder',\n    discrete = True,\n    height = height,\n    aspect = aspect,\n)\nplt.title('Distribution of Cylinder')\nplt.xlabel('Cylinder')\nplt.ylabel('Count of occurance')\nplt.show(g)\n\n# plt.figure()\ng = sns.displot(\n    data = df,\n    x = 'Doors',\n    discrete = True,\n    shrink = 0.5,\n    height = height,\n    aspect = aspect,\n)\nplt.title('Distribution of Doors')\nplt.xlabel('Doors')\nplt.ylabel('Count of occurance')\nplt.show(g)\n\n\n/Users/Bernardo/opt/anaconda3/envs/thesis/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py:118: UserWarning: The figure layout has changed to tight\n  self._figure.tight_layout(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\n/Users/Bernardo/opt/anaconda3/envs/thesis/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py:118: UserWarning: The figure layout has changed to tight\n  self._figure.tight_layout(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Distribution of the variable cylinder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Distribution of the variable doors\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of cylinder and doors variables.\n\n\n\nThe Figure 2 (a) surprised me quite a bit. I had anticipated the car to feature more than 8 cylinders, given that this dataset pertains to American cars. The cylinder count typically spans from 4 to 8, with the values accurately reflecting this range. It’s worth noting that the number of cylinders is expected to be even.\nAgain surprisingly, the Figure 2 (b) shows that the number of doors per car. The values are either 2 or 4, with the latter being more common. This is a bit surprising, as I would have expected the number of doors to be higher for American cars (SUV).\nNext, we check the distribution of the make of the cars in the dataset. For this analysis, we first pivot the dataframe using pd.melt() and calculate the sum by means of groupby() and sum() method as follows:\n\n\nShow the code\nbrands = (\n    df\n    [['Buick', 'Cadillac', 'Chevy', 'Pontiac', 'Saab']]\n    .melt()\n    .groupby('variable')\n    .sum()\n    .reset_index()\n)\n\nbrands.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Cars by brand after melting, grouping, and summing \n  \n    \n      \n      variable\n      value\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Buick\n      80\n    \n    \n      1\n      Cadillac\n      80\n    \n    \n      2\n      Chevy\n      320\n    \n    \n      3\n      Pontiac\n      150\n    \n    \n      4\n      Saab\n      114\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter aggregation, the visualization of the data is as follows:\n\n\nShow the code\nsns.catplot(\n    data    = brands.sort_values('value', ascending=False),\n    x       = 'variable',\n    y       = 'value',\n    kind    = 'bar',\n    height  = 5,\n    aspect  = 2,\n)\nplt.title('Number of cars by brand')\nplt.xlabel('Brand')\nplt.ylabel('Number of cars')\nplt.show()\n\n\n/Users/Bernardo/opt/anaconda3/envs/thesis/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py:118: UserWarning: The figure layout has changed to tight\n  self._figure.tight_layout(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Number of cars by make\n\n\n\n\nIn descending order the most present make is: Chevy followed by Pontiac, Saab, Buick and Cadilac.\nAt this point it should be mentioned, that the data set is not balanced and the distribution of the features is not uniform across the different makes and car features. In a normal project this would be a point to consider and to take care of. However, for the purpose of this project, this is not necessary.\n\n\nModeling\nModeling with statsmodels becomes straightforward once the formula API and provided documentation are well understood. I encountered a minor challenge in grasping the formula API, but once I comprehended it, the usage turned out to be quite intuitive.\nLet’s delve into an understanding of the formula API (statsmodels.formula.api). This feature enables us to employ R-style formulas for specifying models. To illustrate, when fitting a linear model, the following formula suffices:\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\nmodel = smf.ols(\n    formula='y ~ x1 + x2 + x3', \n    data=df\n)\nThe formula API leverages the patsy package (Patsy Package). It’s worth noting that the formula API’s potency extends to intricate models. Additionally, it’s important to mention that the formula API automatically incorporates an intercept into the formula if one isn’t explicitly specified. For cases where the intercept is undesired, a -1 can be used within the formula.\nWith the glm class, a vast array of models becomes accessible importing as follows:\nimport statsmodels.genmod.families.family as fam\nThe fam import is necessary for specifying the family of the model.

It blends the ease of use of Python with exceptional speed, making it an ideal choice for developing robust and efficient web applications. Whether you’re crafting a simple REST API or a complex microservices architecture, FastAPI will help you with that.\nThe installation of FastAPI is very simple and it involves the installation of two packages: (1) FastAPI and (2) Uvicorn. The first one is the framework itself and the second one is the server that will run the API.\npip install fastapi\npip install \"uvicorn[standard]\"\nIn this tutorial, we will build a simple API that will allow us to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. The access to the database will be done by SQLAlchemy, which is a Python SQL toolkit for SQL databases. By the means of fastAPI, we will also provide a documentation of the API, which will be accessible through a web browser."

    "text": "Building API Endpoints\nWe proceed to define various API endpoints using FastAPI’s decorators. These endpoints cover different scenarios, from fetching data for a specific year to creating and updating entries in the database. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and handles specific types of requests.\nFor instance, the index route handles a basic GET request and returns all data from the database, ordered by the year. The get_data_of_year route fetches data for a given year, while get_municipality_data and get_district_data retrieve data for specific municipalities or districts, respectively. Additionally, the create_new_entry, update_tax_entry, update_year_entry, and delete_tax_entry routes allow for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.\nNext, I will show you the incomplete code for the endpoints (the complete code can be found in the end of the article):\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return something\n\n## Create a route to return data for a given year\n@app.get(\"/year/{year}\")\ndef get_data_of_year():\n    return something\n\n## Create a route to return data for a given city\n@app.get(\"/municipality/{municipality}\")\ndef get_municipality_data():\n    return something\n\n## Create a route to return data for a given district\n@app.get(\"/district/{district}\")\ndef get_district_data():\n    return something\n\n## Create a route to return data from the canton\n@app.get(\"/canton/\")\ndef get_canton_data():\n    return something\n\n## Create a new entry\n@app.post('/entry/{municipality}/{year}/{tax}')\ndef create_new_entry():\n    return something\n\n## Update an income tax entry\n@app.put(\"/update_tax/{municipality}/{year}/{tax}\")\ndef update_tax_entry():\n    return something\n    \n## update year entry\n@app.put(\"/update_year/{municipality}/{year_old}/{year_new}\")\ndef update_year_entry():\n    return something\n\n@app.delete(\"/delete/{municipality}/{year}/{tax}\")\ndef delete_tax_entry():\n    return something\nThe components of the the fastapi endpoints are as follows:\n\nDecorators are used to define the route of each endpoints and the HTTP-method.\nType annotation of the parameters allows the definition and validation of the data type of the parameters."

The following codes are use: 400 for Bad Request, 404 for Not Found, and 500 for Internal Server Error. More information can be found here.\nThe implementation of error handling is done by raise HTTPException() as follows:\n## Create a index route\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef index() -> list[IncomeTaxModel]:\n    \n    ...\n\n    result = fetch_return_dict(stmt)\n\n    if result:\n        return result\n    else:\n        raise HTTPException(\n            status_code = 404, \n            detail = f\"Item not found\",\n        )"
