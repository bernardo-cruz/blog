    "text": "Did you ever dream to build your own fast API written in Python?\nFastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It blends the ease of use of Python with exceptional speed, making it an ideal choice for developing robust and efficient web applications. Whether you’re crafting a simple REST API or a complex microservices architecture, FastAPI will help you with that.\nThe installation of FastAPI is very simple and it involves the installation of two packages: (1) FastAPI and (2) Uvicorn. The first one is the framework itself and the second one is the server that will run the API.\npip install fastapi\npip install \"uvicorn[standard]\"\nIn this tutorial, we will build a simple API that will allow us to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. The access to the database will be done by SQLAlchemy, which is a Python SQL toolkit for SQL databases. By the means of fastAPI, we will also provide a documentation of the API, which will be accessible through a web browser."

Our code starts by creating a database connection using the SQLAlchemy library. We’ve chosen an SQLite database for this demonstration. However, you can use any database you like.\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, \n\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table, select, insert, update, delete\n\n## Create a metadata object\nmetadata = MetaData()\n\n## Create a connection to the database\nengine = create_engine(              \n    ## Path to database                     \n    'sqlite:///../../data/FastAPI.db',      # <1>\n)\n\n## Reflect census table from the engine: census\nfastapi = Table(\n    \"fastapi\", \n    metadata,\n    autoload_with = engine,\n)\nMoreover, we create a utility function to connect to the database and return a json-style format. This function will be used in the endpoints to fetch data from the database and return the dictionary, which will be converted to json format by FastAPI.\n## Helper function to fetch data\ndef fetch_return_dict(\n        stmt, \n        engine = engine,\n    ) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Utility function to convert sql query results to dict via pandas dataframe\n    \"\"\"\n    ## Create a connection to the database\n    connection = engine.connection()\n    data = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()\n    connection.close()\n\n    return (\n        pd.DataFrame(\n            data = data\n        )\n        .to_dict(\n            orient = \"records\", \n        )\n    )"

    "text": "Building API Endpoints\nWe proceed to define various API endpoints using FastAPI’s decorators. These endpoints cover different scenarios, from fetching data for a specific year to creating and updating entries in the database. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and handles specific types of requests.\nFor instance, the index route handles a basic GET request and returns all data from the database, ordered by the year. The get_data_of_year route fetches data for a given year, while get_municipality_data and get_district_data retrieve data for specific municipalities or districts, respectively. Additionally, the create_new_entry, update_tax_entry, update_year_entry, and delete_tax_entry routes allow for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.\nNext, I will show you the incomplete code for the endpoints (the complete code can be found in the end of the article):\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    return something\n\n## Create a route to return data for a given year\n@app.get(\"/year/{year}\")\ndef get_data_of_year():\n    return something\n\n## Create a route to return data for a given city\n@app.get(\"/municipality/{municipality}\")\ndef get_municipality_data():\n    return something\n\n## Create a route to return data for a given district\n@app.get(\"/district/{district}\")\ndef get_district_data():\n    return something\n\n## Create a route to return data from the canton\n@app.get(\"/canton/\")\ndef get_canton_data():\n    return something\n\n## Create a new entry\n@app.post('/entry/{municipality}/{year}/{tax}')\ndef create_new_entry():\n    return something\n\n## Update an income tax entry\n@app.put(\"/update_tax/{municipality}/{year}/{tax}\")\ndef update_tax_entry():\n    return something\n    \n## update year entry\n@app.put(\"/update_year/{municipality}/{year_old}/{year_new}\")\ndef update_year_entry():\n    return something\n\n@app.delete(\"/delete/{municipality}/{year}/{tax}\")\ndef delete_tax_entry():\n    return something\nThe components of the the fastapi endpoints are as follows:\n\nDecorators are used to define the route of each endpoints and the HTTP-method.\nType annotation of the parameters allows the definition and validation of the data type of the parameters."

The following codes are use: 400 for Bad Request, 404 for Not Found, and 500 for Internal Server Error. More information can be found here.\nThe implementation of error handling is done by raise HTTPException() as follows:\n## Create a index route\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef index() -> list[IncomeTaxModel]:\n    \n    ...\n\n    result = fetch_return_dict(stmt)\n\n    if result:\n        return result\n    else:\n        raise HTTPException(\n            status_code = 404, \n            detail = f\"Item not found\",\n        )"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nMethod chaining is a way to combine multiple pandas operations together into a single line or statement. It is not necessary to use method chaining, but it can make your code more concise and easier to read. In this post, we will look at how to use method chaining to clean and transform a dataset.\nHonestly, since I started using method chaining, I have found it difficult to go back to the old way of writing pandas code. I hope that by the end of this post, you will feel the same way. :)\nLet’s get started! First I show how to use method chaining to import a dataset as follows:\n\n## Data imports\n\ndf = (\n    # use sm \n    sm                          \n    # get datasets attribute\n    .datasets                   \n    # use get_rdataset method\n    .get_rdataset(              \n        \"car_prices\", \n        package='modeldata'\n    )\n    # get data attribute\n    .data\n)\n\nChaining in Python uses () in order to chain methods together. This allows the user to write multiple statements on different lines as showed in the code above. On big advantage of chaining is that it allows the user to write more readable code (one command per line) and debugg it more easily (comment out one line at a time). Not using chaining would require the user to write the code as follows:\ndf = sm.datasets.get_rdataset(\"car_prices\", package='modeldata').data\nUsing chaining makes the code more readable right?\nWhat I like most about chaining is that it allows the user to write more readable code (one command per line) and debugg it more easily (comment out one line at a time). Especially when working with large datasets, it is very useful to be able to comment out one line at a time.\nBefore continuing with the next section, let’s have a look at the data:\n\n(\n    df\n    .head()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Data Preview \n  \n    \n      \n      Price\n      Mileage\n      Cylinder\n      Doors\n      Cruise\n      Sound\n      Leather\n      Buick\n      Cadillac\n      Chevy\n      Pontiac\n      Saab\n      Saturn\n      convertible\n      coupe\n      hatchback\n      sedan\n      wagon\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      22661.05\n      20105\n      6\n      4\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n    \n    \n      1\n      21725.01\n      13457\n      6\n      2\n      1\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n    \n    \n      2\n      29142.71\n      31655\n      4\n      2\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n    \n    \n      3\n      30731.94\n      22479\n      4\n      2\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n    \n    \n      4\n      33358.77\n      17590\n      4\n      2\n      1\n      1\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset describes the price of sold cars by make, mileage and other features.

But I think you get the point. We can do a lot with method chaining and it is a great way to write clean and readable code.\n\n\nConclusion\nMethod chaining in Pandas is a powerful technique that offers several advantages for data manipulation and analysis workflows. It involves combining multiple operations on a DataFrame or Series into a single, concise chain of method calls. This approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and efficiency.\nFirstly, method chaining reduces the need for intermediate variables, streamlining code and making it more readable. By stringing together operations, such as filtering, transforming, and aggregating, the code becomes a clear and sequential representation of the data transformation process.\nSecondly, it encourages the use of functionally composed operations, leading to more modular and reusable code. This modular nature facilitates changes and updates, as adjustments can be made within the chain without affecting other parts of the code.\nFurthermore, method chaining promotes better memory usage and performance optimization. Pandas optimizes these chains under the hood, reducing the creation of unnecessary intermediate copies of data frames, which leads to improved execution speed and reduced memory overhead.\nLastly, method chaining aligns well with the “tidy data” philosophy, as it emphasizes a more structured, organized approach to data manipulation. This promotes consistency and clarity in the analysis process, aiding in collaboration and code maintenance.\nI hope you enjoyed this post and learned something new.

This article is not going to discuss which language is better, but rather focus on how to use Python and the library statmodels which seems to produce similar outputs as it would in R.\nOne important and cool thing about the statmodels library is that it has a lot of data sets already included. You can find them here. The data set I use is a R data set from Rdatasets. In particular, the dataset from the package modeldata called car_prices is used.\n## Data imports\ndf = (\n    statsmodels.api # imported as sm in following code\n    .datasets\n    .get_rdataset(\"car_prices\", package='modeldata')\n    .data\n)\nAnother important thing about this blog post is the usage of Quarto. Quarto allowed me to write this blog post directly from a Jupyter-Notebook without any fancy and complicated transformations. For more information, please visit the quarto website.\nHowever, let’s start with the analysis. The first thing we do is to import the necessary libraries and the data set.\n\n\nShow the code\n## General imports\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n## Data manipulation imports\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n## Display imports\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\n\n## statmodels import\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nimport statsmodels.genmod.families.family as fam\nfrom patsy import dmatrices\n\n## Plot imports\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (5,5/2.5)\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style('whitegrid')\nsns.set_theme()\nsns.set_context(\n    \"paper\", \n    rc={\n        \"figsize\"       :   plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'],\n        'font_scale'    :   1.25,\n    }\n)\n\n\n## Data imports\ndf = (\n    sm\n    .datasets\n    .get_rdataset(\n        \"car_prices\", \n        package='modeldata',\n    )\n    .data\n)\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory Data Exploration\nThe data exploration is a crucial step before fitting a model. It allows to understand the data and to identify potential problems. In this notebook, we will explore very briefly the data, as the focus of this article is to understand and apply statmodels.\n\n\nThe data set contains 804 observations (rows) and 18 predictors (columns). The data set contains information about car prices and the variables are described as follows: Price; Mileage; Cylinder; Doors; Cruise; Sound; Leather; Buick; Cadillac; Chevy; Pontiac; Saab; Saturn; convertible; coupe; hatchback; sedan; and wagon.\n\n\nFirst, two approximately continous variables Price and Mileage are investigated by means of graphical analysis. The following bar plots show the distribution of the two variables.\n\n\nShow the code\nheight = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][0]\naspect = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][0]/plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][1] / 2\n\ng1 = sns.displot(\n    data = df,\n    x = 'Price',\n    kde = True,\n    height = height,\n    aspect = aspect,\n)\nplt.title('Distribution of car price')\nplt.xlabel('Price')\nplt.ylabel('Count of occurance')\nplt.show(g1)\n\ng2 = sns.displot(\n    data = df,\n    x = 'Mileage',\n    kde = True,\n    height = height,\n    aspect = aspect,\n)\nplt.title('Distribution of Mileage')\nplt.xlabel('Mileage')\nplt.ylabel('Count of occurance')\nplt.show(g2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Distribution of the variable Price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Distribution of the variable Mileage\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of price and mileage variables.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 (a) shows on the left a right-skewed distribution with a peak around 15k$ and price values ranging from 8k dollars to 70k dollars. On the other hand, figure 1 (b) shows on the right a more ballanced distribution with a peak around 20k$ and price values ranging from 266 miles up to 50k miles.\nProceeding to the next two variables, Cylinder and Doors, one can see less possible values, ranging from\n\n\nShow the code\nheight = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][0]\naspect = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][0]/plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'][1] / 2\n\ng = sns.displot(\n    data = df,\n    x = 'Cylinder',\n    discrete = True,\n    height = height,\n    aspect = aspect,\n)\nplt.title('Distribution of Cylinder')\nplt.xlabel('Cylinder')\nplt.ylabel('Count of occurance')\nplt.show(g)\n\n# plt.figure()\ng = sns.displot(\n    data = df,\n    x = 'Doors',\n    discrete = True,\n    shrink = 0.5,\n    height = height,\n    aspect = aspect,\n)\nplt.title('Distribution of Doors')\nplt.xlabel('Doors')\nplt.ylabel('Count of occurance')\nplt.show(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Distribution of the variable cylinder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Distribution of the variable doors\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of cylinder and doors variables.\n\n\n\nThe Figure 2 (a) surprised me quite a bit. I had anticipated the car to feature more than 8 cylinders, given that this dataset pertains to American cars. The cylinder count typically spans from 4 to 8, with the values accurately reflecting this range. It’s worth noting that the number of cylinders is expected to be even.\nAgain surprisingly, the Figure 2 (b) shows that the number of doors per car. The values are either 2 or 4, with the latter being more common. This is a bit surprising, as I would have expected the number of doors to be higher for American cars (SUV).\nNext, we check the distribution of the make of the cars in the dataset. For this analysis, we first pivot the dataframe using pd.melt() and calculate the sum by means of groupby() and sum() method as follows:\n\n\nShow the code\nbrands = (\n    df\n    [['Buick', 'Cadillac', 'Chevy', 'Pontiac', 'Saab']]\n    .melt()\n    .groupby('variable')\n    .sum()\n    .reset_index()\n)\n\nbrands.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Cars by brand after melting, grouping, and summing \n  \n    \n      \n      variable\n      value\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Buick\n      80\n    \n    \n      1\n      Cadillac\n      80\n    \n    \n      2\n      Chevy\n      320\n    \n    \n      3\n      Pontiac\n      150\n    \n    \n      4\n      Saab\n      114\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter aggregation, the visualization of the data is as follows:\n\n\nShow the code\nsns.catplot(\n    data    = brands.sort_values('value', ascending=False),\n    x       = 'variable',\n    y       = 'value',\n    kind    = 'bar',\n    height  = 5,\n    aspect  = 2,\n)\nplt.title('Number of cars by brand')\nplt.xlabel('Brand')\nplt.ylabel('Number of cars')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Number of cars by make\n\n\n\n\nIn descending order the most present make is: Chevy followed by Pontiac, Saab, Buick and Cadilac.\nAt this point it should be mentioned, that the data set is not balanced and the distribution of the features is not uniform across the different makes and car features. In a normal project this would be a point to consider and to take care of. However, for the purpose of this project, this is not necessary.\n\n\nModeling\nModeling with statsmodels becomes straightforward once the formula API and provided documentation are well understood. I encountered a minor challenge in grasping the formula API, but once I comprehended it, the usage turned out to be quite intuitive.\nLet’s delve into an understanding of the formula API (statsmodels.formula.api). This feature enables us to employ R-style formulas for specifying models. To illustrate, when fitting a linear model, the following formula suffices:\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\nmodel = smf.ols(\n    formula='y ~ x1 + x2 + x3', \n    data=df\n)\nThe formula API leverages the patsy package (Patsy Package). It’s worth noting that the formula API’s potency extends to intricate models. Additionally, it’s important to mention that the formula API automatically incorporates an intercept into the formula if one isn’t explicitly specified. For cases where the intercept is undesired, a -1 can be used within the formula.\nWith the glm class, a vast array of models becomes accessible importing as follows:\nimport statsmodels.genmod.families.family as fam\nThe fam import is necessary for specifying the family of the model. The families available are:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: GLM Families\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nFamily(link, variance[, check_link])\nThe parent class for one-parameter exponential families.\n\n\nBinomial([link, check_link])\nBinomial exponential family distribution.\n\n\nGamma([link, check_link])\nGamma exponential family distribution.\n\n\nGaussian([link, check_link])\nGaussian exponential family distribution.\n\n\nInverseGaussian([link, check_link])\nInverseGaussian exponential family.\n\n\nNegativeBinomial([link, alpha, check_link])\nNegative Binomial exponential family (corresponds to NB2).\n\n\nPoisson([link, check_link])\nPoisson exponential family.\n\n\nTweedie([link, var_power, eql, check_link])\nTweedie family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting the model and analyzing the results are the same as one would using R. First define the model, then fit it, then analyze the results. The details of the fit can be accessed using the summary method.\n\n\n                 Generalized Linear Model Regression Results                  \n==============================================================================\nDep.

Here’s a general overview of the information typically included in the summary output:\n\nModel Information:\n\nThe name of the model.\nThe method used for estimation (e.g., maximum likelihood).\nThe distribution family (e.g., Gaussian, binomial, Poisson).\nThe link function used in the model (e.g., logit, identity, etc.).\nThe number of observations used in the model.\n\nModel Fit Statistics:\n\nLog-likelihood value.\nAIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and/or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion).\nDeviance and Pearson chi-square statistics.\nDispersion parameter (if applicable).\n\nCoefficients:\n\nEstimated coefficients for each predictor variable.\nStandard errors of the coefficients.\nz-scores and p-values for testing the significance of the coefficients.\n\nConfidence Intervals:\n\nConfidence intervals for each coefficient, often at a default level like 95%.\n\nHypothesis Testing:\n\nHypothesis tests for the coefficients, typically with null hypothesis being that the coefficient is zero.\n\nGoodness of Fit:\n\nLikelihood-ratio test for overall model fit.\nTests for assessing the contribution of individual predictors to the model.\n\nDiagnostic Information:\n\nInformation about model assumptions and diagnostics, depending on the type of GLM and the method used.\n\nResiduals:\n\nInformation about residuals, which can include measures like deviance residuals, Pearson residuals, etc.\n\n\nRefer to the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information about the summary output for your specific use case.\n\n\nConclusion\nStatsmodels is a powerful Python library for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing, making it an excellent transition for R users or Python users who like R to solve certain problems. It offers a familiar syntax and functionality for regression, ANOVA, and more. Its integration with Python’s data analysis ecosystem, like pandas, allows seamless data manipulation. With support for various statistical methods and a comprehensive summary output, Statsmodels facilitates effortless migration from R, enabling R users to harness its capabilities in a Python environment."

Airflow can use various tools and languages, but the actual workflow code is written with Python. Airflow implements workflows as DAGs, or Directed Acyclic Graphs. Airflow can be accessed and controlled via code, via the command-line, or via a built-in web interface.\n\n\nBefore we can really discuss Airflow, we need to talk about workflows. A workflow is a set of steps to accomplish a given data engineering task. These can include any given task, such as downloading a file, copying data, filtering information, writing to a database, and so forth. A workflow is of varying levels of complexity. Some workflows may only have 2 or 3 steps, while others consist of hundreds of components.\n\n\n\nWorkflow example containing 5 steps\n\n\nThe complexity of a workflow is completely dependent on the needs of the user. We show an example of a possible workflow to the right. It’s important to note that we’re defining a workflow here in a general data engineering sense. This is an informal definition to introduce the concept. As you’ll see later, workflow can have specific meaning within specific tools.\n\n\n\nAirflow is a platform to program workflows (general), including the creation, scheduling, and monitoring of said workflows.\nAirflow can use various tools and languages, but the actual workflow code is written with Python. Airflow implements workflows as DAGs, or Directed Acyclic Graphs. We’ll discuss exactly what this means throughout this course, but for now think of it as a set of tasks and the dependencies between them. Airflow can be accessed and controlled via code, via the command-line, or via a built-in web interface. We’ll look at all these options later on.\n\n\n\nA DAG stands for a Directed Acyclic Graph. In Airflow, this represents the set of tasks that make up your workflow. It consists of the tasks and the dependencies between tasks.\n\n\n\nExample of DAG consisting of five set of tasks\n\n\nDAGs are created with various details about the DAG, including the name, start date, owner, email alerting options, etc.\n\n\n\nWe will go into further detail in the next lesson but a very simple DAG is defined using the following code. A new DAG is created with the dag_id of etl_pipeline and a default_args dictionary containing a start_date for the DAG.\netl_dag = DAG(\n    dag_id = 'etl_pipeline',    \n    default_args = {\"start_date\": \"2020-01-08\"},\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that within any Python code, this is referred to via the variable identifier, etl_dag, but within the Airflow shell command, you must use the dag_id.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get started, let’s look at how to run a component of an Airflow workflow. These components are called tasks and simply represent a portion of the workflow. We’ll go into further detail in later chapters. There are several ways to run a task, but one of the simplest is using the airflow run shell command.\nairflow run <dag_id> <task_id> <start_date>\nAirflow run takes three arguments, a dag_id, a task_id, and a start_date. All of these arguments have specific meaning and will make more sense later in the course. For our example, we’ll use a dag_id of example-etl, a task named download-file, and a start date of 2020-01-10. This task would simply download a specific file, perhaps a daily update from a remote source. Our command as such is airflow run example-etl download-file 2020-01-10. This will then run the specified task within Airflow.\n\n\n\nWe’ve looked at Airflow and some of the basic aspects of why you’d use it. We’ve also looked at how to run a task within Airflow from the command-line. Let’s practice what we’ve learned.\n\n\nYou’ve just started looking at using Airflow within your company and would like to try to run a task within the Airflow platform. You remember that you can use the airflow run command to execute a specific task within a workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that an error while using airflow run will return airflow.exceptions.AirflowException: on the last line of output.\n\n\n\nAn Airflow DAG is set up for you with a dag_id of etl_pipeline. The task_id is download_file and the start_date is 2020-01-08. All other components needed are defined for you.\nWhich command would you enter in the console to run the desired task?\n\nairflow run dag task 2020-01-08\n\nairflow run etl_pipeline task 2020-01-08\n\nairflow run etl_pipeline download_file 2020-01-08\n\n\n\n\nWhile researching how to use Airflow, you start to wonder about the airflow command in general. You realize that by simply running airflow you can get further information about various sub-commands that are available.\nWhich of the following is NOT an Airflow sub-command?\n\nlist_dags\nedit_dag\ntest\nscheduler"

    "text": "DAG in Airflow\nAs we’re working with Airflow, let’s look at its implementation of the DAG concept. Within Airflow, DAGs are written in Python, but can use components written in other languages or technologies. This means we’ll define the DAG using Python, but we could include Bash scripts, other executables, Spark jobs, and so on. Airflow DAGs are made up of components to be executed, such as operators, sensors, etc. Airflow typically refers to these as tasks. We’ll cover these in much greater depth later on, but for now think of a task as a thing within the workflow that needs to be done. Airflow DAGs contain dependencies that are defined, either explicitly or implicitly. These dependencies define the execution order so Airflow knows which components should be run at what point within the workflow. For example, you would likely want to copy a file to a server prior to trying to import it to a database."

    "text": "Define a DAG\nLet’s look at defining a simple DAG within Airflow. When defining the DAG in Python, you must first import the DAG object from airflow dot models. Once imported, we create a default arguments dictionary consisting of attributes that will be applied to the components of our DAG. These attributes are optional, but provide a lot of power to define the runtime behavior of Airflow.\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndefault_arguments = {\n    'owner'         : 'jdoe',\n    'email'         : 'jdoe@email.com', \n    'start_date'    : datetime(2020, 1, 20)\n}\n\netl_dag = DAG(\n    'etl_workflow', \n    default_args = default_arguments\n)\nHere we define the owner name as jdoe, an email address for any alerting, and specify the start date of the DAG. The start date represents the earliest datetime that a DAG could be run. Finally, we define our DAG object with the first argument using a name for the DAG, etl underscore workflow, and assign the default arguments dictionary to the default underscore args argument. There are many other optional configurations we will use later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the entire DAG is assigned to a variable called etl underscore dag. This will be used later when defining the components of the DAG, but the variable name etl underscore dag does not actually appear in the Airflow interfaces. Note, DAG is case sensitive in Python code."

Use the\nairflow -h\ncommand for help and descriptions of the subcommands. Many of these subcommands are related to DAGs.

Your boss would like you to show others on your team how to examine any available DAGs. In this instance, she would like to know which operator is NOT in use with the DAG called update_state, as your team is trying to verify the components used in production workflows.\nRemember that the Airflow UI allows various methods to view the state of DAGs. The Tree View lists the tasks and any ordering between them in a tree structure, with the ability to compress / expand the nodes. The Graph View shows any tasks and their dependencies in a graph structure, along with the ability to access further details about task runs. The Code view provides full access to the Python code that makes up the DAG.\nRemember to select the operator NOT used in this DAG.\n\n\nBashOperator\nPythonOperator\nJdbcOperator\nSimpleHttpOperator"

The BashOperator requires three arguments: the task id which is the name that shows up in the UI, the bash command (the raw command or script), and the dag it belongs to. The BashOperator runs the command in a temporary directory that gets automatically cleaned up afterwards. It is possible to specify environment variables for the bash command to try to replicate running the task as you would on a local system. If you’re unfamiliar with environment variables, these are run-time settings interpreted by the shell. It provides flexibility while running scripts in a generalized way. The first example runs a bash command to echo Example exclamation mark to standard out. The second example uses a predefined bash script for its command, runcleanup.sh."

    "text": "Operator gotchas\nThere are some general gotchas when using Operators. The biggest is that individual operators are not guaranteed to run in the same location or environment. This means that just because one operator ran in a given directory with a certain setup, it does not necessarily mean that the next operator will have access to that same information. If this is required, you must explicitly set it up. You may need to set up environment variables, especially for the BashOperator.\n\nFor example, it’s common in bash to use the tilde character to represent a home directory. This is not defined by default in Airflow.\n\n\nAnother example of an environment variable could be AWS credentials, database connectivity details, or other information specific to running a script.\n\nFinally, it can also be tricky to run tasks with any form of elevated privilege. This means that any access to resources must be setup for the specific user running the tasks. If you’re uncertain what elevated privileges are, think of running a command as root or the administrator on a system."

These further process your data and copy to its final location.\nThe DAG analytics_dag is available as before, and your cleanup task is still defined.

    "text": "Airflow scheduler presets\nAirflow has several presets, or shortcut syntax options representing often used time intervals.\n\n\n\nPreset\ncron equivalent\n\n\n\n\n@hour\n0 * * * *\n\n\n@daily\n0 0 * * *\n\n\n@weekly\n0 0 * * 0\n\n\n@monthly\n0 0 1 * *\n\n\n@yearly\n0 0 1 1 *\n\n\n\nThe @hourly preset means run once an hour at the beginning of the hour. It’s equivalent to 0 asterisk asterisk asterisk asterisk in cron. The @daily, @weekly, @monthly, and @yearly presets behave similarly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: “0 12 * * ” != “ 12 * * *”\n“0 12 * * *” This cron expression specifies a specific minute and hour. It means the task should run at 12:00 PM (noon) every day. The 0 in the first position represents the minute, and 12 in the second position represents the hour.\n“* 12 * * *” This cron expression uses an asterisk in the minute position, which means the task will run every minute of the 12th hour (noon) of every day. In other words, it will run once every minute between 12:00 PM and 12:59 PM."

When scheduling DAG runs, Airflow will use the start date as the earliest possible value, but not actually schedule anything until at least one schedule interval has passed beyond the start date. Given a start_date of February 25, 2020 and a @daily schedule interval, Airflow would then use the date of February 26, 2020 for the first run of the DAG. This can be tricky to consider when adding new DAG schedules, especially if they have longer schedule intervals."
