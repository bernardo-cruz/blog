    "title": "Predictive Maintenance - Part 1",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Objective\nThe objective of predictive maintenance is quite easy to explain: It is to predict when a machine or a component will fail or not. This makes it possible to move from a preventive maintenance approach to a predictive maintenance approach. This approach is more efficient because it allows to avoid unnecessary maintenance operations and to anticipate the failures of the machines. This approach is also more economical because it allows to avoid the immobilization of the machines for maintenance operations that are not necessary. The hard part of predictive maintenance is to get label, fail = yes and fail = no as well as the when. It sounds quite obvious, but, normally the maintenance schedule is organized in such a way, that the failure does not occur between the checks. In my current work, we have a lot of data, but we do not have the labels. So, we have to find a way to get the labels. In this post, I will show you how I did it.\nImagine you have a heating-ventilation-and-air-conditioning (HVAC) system. Normally, this system consists of several interconnected subsystems such as ventilation, heat-exchanger unit etc. Each of these subsystems consists of several components such as fans, pumps, valves, heat exchangers etc. Each of these components has a specific function and is subject to wear and tear. The wear and tear of these components can lead to a failure of the component. The failure of a component can lead to the failure of the subsystem. The failure of a subsystem can lead to the failure of the HVAC system. The failure of the HVAC leads to discomfort of the passengers. However, is it possible to predict the when based on historical data?\nThe important question is how to do it. In data science jargon, which variables lead to this state? What can be measured? One could measure the temperature of the air, the temperature of the water, the pressure of the air, the pressure of the water, the flow of the air, the flow of the water, the speed of the fans, the speed of the pumps, the position of the valves, the position of the dampers, the power consumption of the fans, the power consumption of the pumps, the power consumption of the heat exchangers, the power consumption of the HVAC system‚Ä¶ The most obvious technique is to concentrate on the power consumption and treat the subsystems etc. as detail information. This is what we did.\n\n\nCoding\nWe used Gaussian-Mixture-Models1 to try to find a pattern which deviates from the normal behavior. The normal behavior corresponds to the historical data obtained by energy counters and lies with the distribution.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sklearn.mixture as mix\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n\n# Generate data\nX, y = make_blobs(\n    n_samples=100*60*24*7, \n    centers=3, \n    n_features=2,\n    random_state=0\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model‚Ü©Ô∏é"
